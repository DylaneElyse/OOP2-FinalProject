# OOP2 Final Project

This project is a Library Management System.

The UI features a Home page, a Users page, and a Book page. These pages allow users to add, edit or delete any users, books, or book rentals and they connect to a SQLite Database. 

The book rental page pulls the information stored under the User and Book to complete a rental. It will display this information on the page once selected so the user can confirm the information is accurate. The return date is automatically updated as 2 weeks after the rental date.
